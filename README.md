# LoRaWAN
LoRaWAN_Final_Thesis pdf file is my bachelor's final project thesis which was focused on LoRaWAN communication technology. This project includes two main parts:

1- Implementation of a LoRaWAN infrastructure including 5 end-devices,  3 gateways, a network server, and an application server on TTN servers. 
2- Evaluation of the implemented LoRaWAN infrastructure in urban scenarios, including stationary scenarios, and mobile scenarios. 

The thesis script is written in Farsi (Persian language) since it was presented to my university at my undergraduate studies (Tehran Polytechnic). 
There is an English abstract of the project at the end of the thesis.
